## Notes:
Our original idea was to create a first-person survival horror game with multiplayer support (the attached PowerPoint). However, it wasn’t approved (“not unique enough,” said one of the professors), so we had to brainstorm a new concept—an RPG.

This was a major setback for us, as while other teams had the full 8 weeks to build their games, we only had 6.
Moreover, most of our team was new to Unity, and we needed about a week just to learn the engine, effectively reducing our actual development time to 5 weeks.

Nevertheless, we’re proud of what we accomplished in such a short amount of time.
