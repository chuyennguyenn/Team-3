  - 'Boss: You are a strong alchemist, young man

'
  - 'Boss: To be that strong your master must be godric

'
  - 'Boss: He taught me all about rock alchemy'
  - 'Boss: He was a good man, but the debt he put me in was unfair, the collectors
    forced me into hiding in this miserable heat'
  - 'Boss: THEY MUST CROSS A DESERT FOR ME'
  - 'Merrick: I''m in the same position as you except for the collectors. Why did
    you resort to this?

'
  - 'Boss: The world is unfair so I MUST BE UNFAIR'
  - "Merrick: Ah now I see, you could\u2019ve taken any other path but you run from
    your problems,"
  - 'Merrick: all their trade has slowed down, do you know that?'
  - 'Boss: A small price for freedom'
  - 'Merrick: My master would have you clean the floors for days, and you know he
    would want the best for you'
  - 'Merrick: Is your best truly hiding in a desert?'
  - "Boss: You\u2019re right\u2026."
  - 'Boss: My master trained me to be adaptable and here I am rigid and inflexible
    like the rocks that covered me'
  - 'Boss: I will leave this town, and keep running from the collectors until I have
    enough coins. Sort of like yourself. Now let me be.

'
  - 'Merrick: Alright
